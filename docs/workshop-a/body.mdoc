**What is a PR?**

A PR in GitHub is a Pull Request â€”&nbsp;you requesting that code from your *branch* gets *pulled* into the main branch, so your changes get merged into the working codebase.

Before that happens though, it's good practice to have someone who reviews your changes. That way, they can point out things that you might have overlooked or things to make your code better.
