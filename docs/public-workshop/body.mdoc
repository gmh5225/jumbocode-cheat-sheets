## Frontend vs. backend

At a high level, apps are built from a few components:

- **Frontend:** The part of the app that you interact with, like text, images, buttons, forms, etc.
- **Backend:** The part of the app that stores, organizes, and acts upon data.

The **database** is a piece of software that the backend uses to store data.

The frontend and backend are two separate apps, which run on *two separate computers:*

- The **frontend** runs on **each user’s device**
- The **backend** runs on **centralized servers**
