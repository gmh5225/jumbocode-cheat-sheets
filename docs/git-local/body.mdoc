## Logging out

If your credentials don't work anymore (maybe your token expired), you can have Git forget your username and password by running:

```bash
git config --global --unset credential.helper
```

## Remember me

If get is asking for your username and password every time, run the following command:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

You'll need to enter your password once more after this, and then it should be saved from then on.
